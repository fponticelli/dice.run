Type your dice expressions in the box.

The simples expression is [`d`](#/d/d) which means roll one die with 6 faces. You can be more explicit and input [`1d6`](#/d/1d6). Of course you can run multiple dice ([`3d6`](#/d/3d6)) and with different number of sides [`2d10`](#/d/2d10).

You can use basic mathematical operators [`3d6 + 4 - 1d4`](#/d/3d6+4-1d4).
